## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Course - FreeCodeCamp Certification

Hello! This repository houses all my completed projects for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification provided by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I developed these projects as part of my journey in learning JavaScript, and I am pleased to showcase them here. 

### Course Overview

The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course provided by FreeCodeCamp is an extensive 300 hours course designed to solidify foundational JavaScript knowledge and skills. The course consists of several sections, each focusing on various aspects of JavaScript:

- Basic JavaScript

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

### Projects

I've completed five projects as part of this certification, each designed to test understanding and ability to apply JavaScript concepts:

1. **Palindrome Checker**: A function that checks whether a provided string is a palindrome.

2. **Roman Numeral Converter**: A function that converts a given number into a roman numeral.

3. **Caesars Cipher**: A simple decryption algorithm commonly known as a Caesar's Cipher.

4. **Telephone Number Validator**: A function that validates whether a given number matches the pattern of a US telephone number.

5. **Cash Register**: A function that simulates the transaction process of a cash register.

Each project is located in its respective folder in this repository
